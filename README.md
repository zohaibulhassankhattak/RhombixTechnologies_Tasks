## Overview
This repository contains the HTML, and css files for a responsive, organized photo gallery, which you can host on an Amazon S3 bucket. Once set up, it will be available as a publicly accessible static website.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account
- IAM user with appropriate permissions for S3
- Basic knowledge of HTML + CSS and S3
- AWS CLI installed (optional but recommended for easy S3 uploads)

## Steps to Host on AWS S3

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to the S3 service in AWS and click on "Create bucket."
   - Name your bucket (e.g., `my-photo-gallery`) and select a region.

2. **Enable Static Website Hosting**:
   - In your S3 bucket settings, go to **Properties** > **Static website hosting**.
   - Choose "Enable" and set up the index document as `index.html`.
   - Optionally, set up an error document (e.g., `404.html`).

3. **Set Bucket Policy** (for public access):
   - Go to **Permissions** > **Bucket Policy**.
   - Add the following policy to allow public access:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": "s3:GetObject",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Replace `your-bucket-name` with your actual bucket name.

4. **Upload Files**:
   - Upload your HTML and CSS, and image files to the S3 bucket.
   - You can either drag-and-drop files in the S3 console or use the AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name --acl public-read
     ```

5. **Access Your Website**:
   - Once the files are uploaded, go to the **Properties** section of your S3 bucket.
   - Copy the **Static website hosting URL** to access your website.

## Running Locally
To test the website locally before uploading:
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
- Verify that images, carousel, and other features are functioning.

## Configuration for S3 Bucket
Ensure all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are publicly accessible. Check your bucket policy and adjust file permissions if needed.

## Demo Link
After deploying, access your gallery via the link provided in your bucket's **Static website hosting** settings.
